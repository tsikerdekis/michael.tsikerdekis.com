Hello there and welcome to my personal website! I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Western Washington University, located in the small but quaint city of Bellingham WA. Also, an IEEE Senior Member and chair of the [PISCES](https://pisces-nw.org/) Technical Advisory Committee.

### Science
My background is in Computer Science and covers many years of interdisciplinary work in academic departments varying from Sociology to Information Science. My research interests revolve around online deception, cybersecurity, data mining and machine learning.

### Books
I like a variety of books from fantasy (high, contemporary, epic, dark, etc.) to non-fiction scientific books. I write on my free time books with compelling characters and inspiring stories.

### Personal
On a more personal level, I should also mention my great love and appreciation for the outdoors and the energy that feeds my inner self from the experiences created in the natural world with my beautiful family. Parallel to this, lies my utter devotion to the world of video games (of all genres) and the adventures created within the digital world.
