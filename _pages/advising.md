## For Senior Project override and Graduation

You need to go to DegreeWorks:

- Add all remaining courses that you plan to take.
- If there are courses that do not have a code yet, add another of similar credit.
- Then check that all degree requirements are checked (checkboxes should be full for most items).
- Export that view as a PDF. This should include all planned course (you will see them at the bottom).
- Send this to me via email.
