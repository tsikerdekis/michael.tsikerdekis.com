### When do you need to start Senior Project (CSCI 491)?
Typically three quarters before you graduate. Summer does not count since 49x is not offered during the summer. If it takes you one more quarter after finishing 493, it is okay.

### When do you need to apply for Graduation?
One quarter before you graduate.

### What do you need for Senior Project override and Graduation?

You need to go to DegreeWorks:

- Add all remaining courses that you plan to take, in the What-If tab.
- If there are courses that do not have a code yet, add another of similar credit. Hit Process.
- Then check that all degree requirements are checked (checkboxes should be full for most items).
- Export that view as a PDF (there is a print button at the top). This should include all planned courses (you will see them at the bottom).
- Send this to me via email.

### Can you get an override for other courses that you are waitlisted?
It depends, but typically unlikely. You need to message the instructor of the course. If there is a serious reason, you may be able to get an override.
