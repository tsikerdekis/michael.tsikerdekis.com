## For Senior Project override and Graduation

You need to go to DegreeWorks:

- Add all remaining courses that you plan to take, in the What-If tab.
- If there are courses that do not have a code yet, add another of similar credit. Hit Process.
- Then check that all degree requirements are checked (checkboxes should be full for most items).
- Export that view as a PDF (there is a print button at the top). This should include all planned courses (you will see them at the bottom).
- Send this to me via email.
