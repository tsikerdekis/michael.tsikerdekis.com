* A friendly illustrated guide to designing and implementing your first database. *

Data is the backbone of computer science, and databases are the main way that data is stored, exchanged, manipulated, and managed. Whether you’re a software developer, a data scientist, or an enthusiastic business user looking to up your data analysis skills, it pays to learn how to create and query relational databases like MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. Grokking Relational Database Design will get you started!

In Grokking Relational Database Design, you’ll learn how to:

- Query and create databases using Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Design databases from scratch
- Implement and optimize database designs
- Take advantage of generative AI when designing databases

A well-constructed database is easy to understand, query, manage, and scale when your app needs to grow. In Grokking Relational Database Design you’ll learn the basics of relational database design including how to name fields and tables, which data to store where, how to eliminate repetition, good practices for data collection and hygiene, and much more. You won’t need a computer science degree or in-depth knowledge of programming—the book’s practical examples and down-to-earth definitions are beginner-friendly.
