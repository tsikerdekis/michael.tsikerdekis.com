# Welcome to the subscribed content

I'll keep in touch, aiming for one communication per month. I will sending out emails regarding the progress of my other books as well as other interesting life stories and facts around topics of science, science fiction and fantasy. **Look out for the first email hiding some bonus story on how started writing this book over the next day or two.**

However, I could not leave you empty handed. As promised, please find below a list of the bonus materials from the Journeys of the Lost: The Saga of Cane. Oh, and don't forget, if you liked the book, please consider leaving a review [here](https://amazon.com).
