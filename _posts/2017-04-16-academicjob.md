title: What is the probability of getting an academic job?
---

<p>
	It is an interesting thought experiment that can be dissected in several ways depending on how it is addressed.</p>

<p>
	So, I figured why not just create github.com Shiny R application that builds estimates depending on the input. The current formula is a crude estimation that assumes there in an N population of positions that become available based on an independent probabiltiy p and there is a competing number of w applicants which are chosen at random. <strong>For CS and CE jobs in US and Canada based on CRA's survey data is around 50%.</strong></p>

<p>
	The Shiny R application for playing around wtih the input can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://tsikerdekis.shinyapps.io/AcademicJobProbability/">https://tsikerdekis.shinyapps.io/AcademicJobProbability/</a></p>
